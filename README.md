# Jiffy
Browser Extension that replaces links to GIFs with links to GIFVs

## Inspiration
HTML5 GIFs (GIFVs) load faster and play better than the original GIF format. We wanted to make a browser extension that uses GIFVs where possible.

## How it works
Our extension finds links to GIFs on your current webpages and checks if a GIFV with a similar link exists. If so, it will automatically update the original link to the better GIFV file.

## Browser support
Our extension currently supports both Chrome and Safari
